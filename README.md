## Connector for elFinder in nodejs

This is connector for elFinder in nodejs.

## Usage

See sample/routes/elfinder.js

** NOTE: ** volumes folders must be pre-created. Including the folders for thumbnails and uploading files.

Most of the elFinder function is working but the connector is not ready for production.
Some commands are not implemented yet. 


I did not maintain this project for a while. Please checkout @dekyfin folk for a better version: [Elfinder-node](https://github.com/dekyfin/elfinder-node)
